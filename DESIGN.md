# Varys v2 — Design Decision Record

> Visual-regression test automation platform: **record → baseline → rerun → compare**, with
> a trace-powered timeline, folder/tag/suite organization, environment-agnostic recordings,
> pluggable storage, and a phase-2 Claude/MCP authoring layer.
>
> This document is the durable output of a full design interview. Every decision below was
> deliberately chosen, with the rejected alternatives and rationale considered at the time.
> Status: **design locked, pre-implementation.** Greenfield — no v1 to migrate from.

## 0. Product in one paragraph

A user installs a **Chrome extension** and records a test by interacting with *any* web app
(their own product first, but the tool must work on apps they don't control). The extension
captures a portable, environment-agnostic **test definition** (ordered steps + element
fingerprints + checkpoints). A hosted backend **replays** that test server-side with
Playwright, screenshots designated elements, and **diffs** them against an approved baseline
per environment. Results land in a **test × environment dashboard**; failures are
investigated via a **Playwright-trace timeline** and resolved in a **diff viewer**
(approve → new baseline, or reject → regression). Tests are organized with **folders + tags +
suites** and run **manually or on a schedule**. Later, **Claude (via an MCP server)** can
author tests by driving a live session that Varys records.

**MVP slice:** `record → replay → diff one element`. No timeline polish, folders, multi-env,
or Claude in the first cut — just the core loop proven end-to-end.

## 1. Foundation

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Prior art | **Greenfield** — no v1 to reuse or migrate |
| Deployment | **Hosted, multi-user service** |
| Database | **PostgreSQL + JSONB** (binary artifacts go to object storage, never the DB) |
| Recorder architecture | **Chrome extension (capture) + Playwright (replay)** |
| First slice | **record → replay → diff one element** |

**Why Postgres:** the core data is a relational entity graph (tests → steps, runs → results,
folders + tags + environments + members). The one document-shaped thing — a recorded test as
an ordered step list with flexible per-step config — is handled by **JSONB columns**, giving
document flexibility inside a relational store. Rejected: MongoDB (relational queries
dominate), SQLite (single-writer, wrong for hosted multi-user), time-series DBs (run history
isn't high-frequency telemetry).

---

## 2. Recorder internals

### Element location (the robustness core)
- **Stance:** app-agnostic core, **extensible to any app**, tuned so the datagenie product
  works flawlessly. Must work on apps whose source we don't control.
- **Locator engine:** capture a **multi-signal fingerprint** per element at record time —
  `tag, role, accessible name, text, key attributes, ancestor chain, DOM index, neighbor/label
  text, CSS-module classes, bounding box`. Ship a **simple ranked matcher for the MVP**, evolve
  to **confidence-scored matching later — without re-recording** (the signals are already
  stored). Capturing only a single selector is the one unrecoverable mistake.
- **`data-testid`:** optional *top-weighted* signal when the app is owned; **never required**.
  (The app under test currently has none.)
- **CSS-module classes** (`*.module.scss` → hashed): **weak corroborating signal only**
  (version-fragile, opaque). Weight goes on role/text/structure/neighbors.
- **Self-heal:** below-threshold match → complete but **flag "low-confidence — review"**
  (record which signal won); **no candidate clears the floor → hard-fail + surface for repair.**
  Load-bearing for black-box targets, which have an irreducible flakiness floor.

### Environment-agnostic variables
Governing principle: **structure is static, data is variable, ask only about the ambiguous
middle (typed values).**

| Tier | Examples | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Always variable (auto) | navigation origin → `{{baseUrl}}`; `type=password` → `{{secret}}` | system decides |
| Always static | URL path segments, clicks/hovers/scrolls, waits, DOM-structural selector parts | system decides |
| Ambiguous | typed input values; selectors keyed off visible text | **inline one-tap confirm** with heuristic default |

Heuristic default: data-shaped value (entity/dataset name, GUID, date, long id, free-text) →
suggest **Variable**; short/enumerable UI value → suggest **Static**. **Selector guard:** warn
if the chosen locator depends on env-specific visible text; bind it to the variable or drop to
a structural locator. Variable *values* live in per-environment profiles, not in the test.

### Wait conditions
Composable **per-step primitives**: `fixed delay (ms)` · `network-idle` ·
`wait-for-request/response matching a URL glob/regex (+ optional status)` ·
`wait-for-selector appear/disappear/settle`. **Smart default before every screenshot:**
auto network-idle + brief visual-stability check, overridable per step.

### Screenshot-target selection
Devtools-style **inspect mode**: activate capture → hover highlights → click to pick. Modes:
**element / full-page / manual region.** Stores fingerprint + bounding box. **Dynamic
sub-regions are masked in the same gesture** (feeds diff masking).

### App-under-test authentication
- **Login recorded as steps**, run **fresh once per run** (session reused across that run's
  steps to avoid lockout/rate-limits). **No MFA** in scope.
- Credentials → **per-environment encrypted secret vault** (envelope encryption/KMS),
  decrypted only inside the runner — never in the client, UI, or logs.
- Because the tool screen-records + captures network, secrets are scrubbed everywhere:
  password input regions **redacted in video**; `Authorization` headers, cookies, and
  auth-endpoint bodies **scrubbed from network capture**; variables surface as `{{secret:…}}`.

---

## 3. Step schema (the record ↔ replay ↔ diff ↔ DB contract)

A recorded test is a **versioned JSONB document** (`test_versions.definition`) — authored/edited
atomically, with history. **Single viewport** captured at record time, **chromium-only** for MVP.

```ts
Test {
  id; name; description
  viewport: { width; height; deviceScaleFactor }   // captured at record time
  browser: 'chromium'
  variables: Variable[]                            // declared tokens; values live per-env
  steps: Step[]                                    // ordered
}
Variable { name; kind: 'url' | 'data' | 'secret' }

StepCommon { id; index; waitBefore?: Wait[]; note? }
Navigate   = StepCommon & { type:'navigate'; url:string /* "{{baseUrl}}/dashboard" */ }
Interact   = StepCommon & {
  type:'click'|'hover'|'scroll'|'type'|'select'|'press'
  target: Fingerprint
  value?: string          // literal | "{{dataset}}" | "{{secret:password}}"
}
Screenshot = StepCommon & {
  type:'screenshot'; name: string  // checkpoint name → part of the baseline key
  captureMode:'element'|'fullpage'|'region'
  target?: Fingerprint; rect?: Rect
  masks?: (Fingerprint | Rect)[]; threshold?: number
}

type Wait =
  | { kind:'delay'; ms:number }
  | { kind:'networkIdle'; timeoutMs? }
  | { kind:'request'|'response'; urlPattern:string; status?; timeoutMs? }
  | { kind:'selector'; target:Fingerprint; state:'visible'|'hidden'|'stable'; timeoutMs? }

Fingerprint {
  testId?; role?; accessibleName?; text?; tag
  attributes?; ancestors?: { tag; role? }[]
  domIndex?; neighborText?: string[]; moduleClasses?: string[]; boundingBox?: Rect
}
```

**Postgres tables** (artifacts → storage adapter, everything else relational + JSONB):

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `tests` → `test_versions(definition jsonb)` | versioned test document |
| `environments` | dev / demo / lnrs / cfg / carvana |
| `environment_profiles(values jsonb)` | per-env variable values; secrets encrypted/ref'd |
| `runs` | (test_version, env, status, timing) |
| `run_results` | per-checkpoint: status, diff_score, confidence, healed_selector?, artifact refs |
| `baselines` | keyed `(test, checkpoint_name, env, viewport)` → artifact ref + approval; current only |
| `artifacts` | blob refs only (video, baseline, actual, diff images, traces) |

---

## 4. Baseline lifecycle

**Critical principle: recording ≠ baseline.** The extension captures in the *user's* browser
(their fonts/DPR/AA); replay happens in *server-side Playwright* (headless Linux, bundled
fonts). Those render differently, so **the baseline must be generated by the same engine that
replays.** The recording's screenshot is a *target + preview + mask surface*, not the golden.

```
1. RECORD   (client/extension) → test definition: steps, fingerprints, targets, masks, waits, vars
2. SEED     (server/Playwright) → first replay per environment captures the GOLDEN baselines
3. APPROVE  → human eyeballs seeded baselines once → test goes active
4. RUN      (server/Playwright) → compare actual vs approved baseline
5. ON DIFF  → review → APPROVE (new baseline) or REJECT (regression/bug)
```

- **First baseline:** auto-seed → stays *pending* → **one-time human approval** → active.
- **Approval authority:** any project member, **audited** (who + when + old→new).
- **History:** **current only** — old baseline **deleted on replacement → no rollback.**
  Approval is therefore irreversible; **the approve action gets a hard confirm** ("permanently
  replaces the baseline — no undo"). *(Accepted risk #1.)*
- **Determinism pinning** (asserted, non-negotiable): pinned runner image — same chromium
  version, same fonts, fixed viewport/DPR, animations frozen (`prefers-reduced-motion` + CSS
  freeze), dynamic regions masked.
- **Per-env baselines** seed independently (data differs across environments).
- The **diff viewer** does double duty: step-3 initial approval *and* step-5 diff resolution.

---

## 5. Organization model

- **Tenancy:** single-org internal, **multi-tenant-ready** (`org_id` on the root so multi-tenant
  is a later flip, not a migration). `Org → Projects → Members`; environments + tests scoped to
  a Project.
- **Grouping:** **folders** (one browsable home per test) + **tags** (many-to-many slicing:
  `release:5.0`, `feature:dashboard`, custom) + **suites** (a saved selection = the run unit).
  Folders = where it lives; tags = how you slice/run it.
- **Two axes:** *what* to run (selection) × *where* to run (environment).
  **customer = environment** (lnrs/cfg/carvana are deployments, not folders).
  A run = `suite × env(s)`.

---

## 6. Playback infrastructure

- **Shape:** API control plane → **Postgres-backed job queue** (pg-boss / `SKIP LOCKED`) →
  horizontally-scalable pool of **pinned-chromium Playwright worker containers**. Each
  **test-job = fresh browser context + fresh login + sequential steps**, with per-step/test
  timeouts.
- **Parallelism:** **test-level fan-out/fan-in** — a suite-run becomes one job per test across
  the pool (concurrency capped by pool size), aggregated into a parent run report. Steps within
  a test stay sequential.
- **Triggers (MVP):** **manual + scheduled (cron).** API/CI webhook is a fast-follow (same rail,
  extra doorway). A schedule = `(suite) × (env(s)) × (when)`.
- **Retries:** **retry errors (default 1×, fresh attempt), never retry diffs** (a diff is a real
  result, not a fluke). Statuses: `passed` / `passed-with-heal-flag` / `diff (needs review)` /
  `error (retrying)` / `failed (errors exhausted)`.

---

## 7. Storage & artifact retention

- **`StorageAdapter`** interface (`put / get / getUrl / delete`). **Local FS for MVP**;
  **Azure Blob + S3** later, chosen by **env var**. `getUrl(key)` → signed blob URL (cloud) or
  authenticated API route (local) — the UI doesn't care. Path-addressed keys:
  `org/project/test/checkpoint/env/viewport/{baseline | run-<id>}/{kind}.png`.
- **Retention: tiered by outcome** — failed/diff artifacts kept ~90d, passing ~7d, baselines
  while current (configurable defaults).
- **Old baseline on approval: deleted immediately → no rollback** (consistent with §4).
- **Video: off by default; recorded only when toggled on per test.** *Checkpoints
  (screenshots + action markers) are always captured regardless* — so the timeline always has
  markers, scrubbable video only when toggled.

---

## 8. Diff / comparison viewer

- **View modes:** all four — **side-by-side, diff-highlight overlay, swipe slider,
  onion-skin/blink — with a switchable control.**
- **Review actions:** per-checkpoint approve/reject **+ bulk "approve all in run"**; every action
  audited; **irreversible-confirm** on approve.
- **In-viewer tuning:** **draw masks + nudge per-checkpoint threshold live, re-evaluate
  instantly**; the mask/threshold persists to the test for future runs. (Primary defense against
  false-positive fatigue.)

---

## 9. Timeline UI

- **Powered by Playwright traces** (per-step before/after screenshots, DOM snapshot, network,
  console — timestamped + scrubbable), with **optional video** layered in when toggled on. A
  trace is a richer "what went wrong" record than video.
- **Trace retention:** ~~retain-on-failure + every baseline-seed~~ → **superseded (slice 9
  shipped): per-trigger on demand only** — a "keep trace" toggle on the run/suite-run trigger;
  nothing is kept automatically. Revisit auto-retention only if on-demand proves insufficient.
- **Embed Playwright's Trace Viewer** for the MVP — **self-hosted** at `/trace-viewer` (served
  by the API from the `playwright-core` bundle) so the "Open timeline" link is same-origin as
  the trace artifact. (The hosted `trace.playwright.dev` can't fetch a localhost/loopback
  artifact — browsers block public→local — so self-hosting is required for local dev and works
  deployed too.) Build a custom branded timeline later. Slice 9 also persists a per-step
  **run_steps** timeline (every run) as that custom UI's data skeleton.

---

## 10. Run dashboard

- **Hero view:** **test × environment status matrix** (cell = latest status → drill to run →
  checkpoints → diff viewer), with a runs activity feed alongside.
- **Alerts:** **Slack + in-app inbox** on diffs/failures (no email for MVP).
- **History:** **per-checkpoint trend sparklines** so flaky/newly-broken checkpoints stand out.

---

## 11. Authentication & authorization

- **Authorization:** **flat model** — every authenticated org member can do everything,
  including create/edit environments + their login secrets. **No role gating for MVP.**
  Hedges: keep a `role` column on membership (tighten later = config flip, not migration);
  secrets remain encrypted-at-rest + scrubbed regardless. *(Accepted risk #2 — see below.)*
- **Authentication:** **both** Google SSO (domain-restricted) **and** email/password,
  **OIDC-ready**. Use a **proven auth library/provider, never hand-rolled.**

---

## 12. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | **TypeScript** everywhere |
| Repo | **pnpm + Turborepo monorepo**; shared packages: step-schema types, locator engine, storage adapter |
| API | **NestJS** (guards fit RBAC, interceptors fit audit) |
| Frontend | **React SPA (Vite)** + **TanStack Query** + **CSS Modules** |
| Worker | separate **Playwright** service |
| DB access | **Drizzle** (SQL-first, first-class JSONB) |
| Extension | **WXT** (Vite-powered MV3, shares monorepo types) |
| DB / queue / storage | Postgres / pg-boss / StorageAdapter (per above) |
| Timeline | embed Playwright Trace Viewer |

---

## 13. Claude / MCP automation (phase 2)

- **AI surface:** Varys ships an **MCP server, Claude-Code-driven** — exposes its primitives
  (drive the live browser, take screenshots/checkpoints, create/save a draft test, run a test).
- **Authoring mechanism:** Claude **drives a live session that Varys records** — exactly like a
  human recording, reusing the full recorder pipeline (fingerprints, variables, waits). Claude
  perceives the page via accessibility tree + screenshots the MCP returns. *(Not* direct JSON
  emission — that guesses selectors without touching the real DOM.)
- **Inputs:** **SRS/spec docs + Figma/design + live exploration** of the app.
- **Safety:** **unrestricted, full trust** — no environment limits, no mutation
  detection/gating. *(Accepted risk #2.)*
- **Output workflow:** AI-authored test lands in a **draft** → **human reviews/edits** in the
  recorder/diff UI → **promotes** into a folder + tags. (This is the one human checkpoint on AI
  output.)
- **In-product surface (slice 15 — Author with AI):** the same server-side **Authoring Session**
  is drivable from a chat **inside the Varys web app**, with the model running on the **user's
  own Claude subscription** via a small local **Bridge Helper** (Claude Agent SDK) that relays
  the conversation to the web UI; Varys streams a **live browser preview** server-side. *(A
  third-party app can't spend a user's subscription quota and can't tap a Claude Code session it
  didn't launch — hence the local helper.)* Review/**promote** stay web-UI-only. See
  `prd/author-with-ai.md`.

---

## ⚠️ Accepted risks (chosen knowingly)

1. **Irreversible baseline approval** — old baselines are deleted on replace; a mistaken approval
   is unrecoverable. Mitigation: hard confirm dialog on approve.
2. **Unrestricted AI on live/customer-prod environments** — Claude may perform mutating actions
   (submit/delete/pay) anywhere while authoring, and recorded mutations **replay unattended on
   every scheduled run**, including customer production. No mutation flagging or gating.
